      <p>
      Kaffe is Danish for—you guessed it—coffee. And I love kaffe. After working in the beverage industry for nearly a decade, I switched careers and became a software developer. Kaffe, this app, is the merging of those passions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Kaffe is a pet-project of mine to get better at quickly testing out new ideas—"Weekend Builds," if you will. I began my journey as a software developer using <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, and I continue to use it to build minimal viable prodcuts quickly, but for a lot of my small ideas, it's a bit of a heavy lift. Like this app for instance, using Rails to build a static site with a JavaScript timer is way overkill. Similarly, when I built <a href="http://bobby-bus.herokuapp.com/">Bobby</a> (please await the Heroku bootup time), I felt silly using Rails because there wasn't really a reason to render anything server-side.
      </p>
      <p>
      So with Kaffe, I decided to keep everything client-side: HTML, CSS (with the help of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>), and JavaScript (with the help of <a href="https://www.stimulusjs.org">stimulus</a>)!
